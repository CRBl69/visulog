# Visulog

*Tool for analysis and visualization of git logs*

## Presentation

Visulog a tool for analyzing contributions from the members of a team working a a same given project hosted on a git repository. Its goal is to assist teachers for individual grading of students working as a team.

This tool can:

- compute a couple of relevant indicators such as:
  - number of lines or characters added/deleted/changed
  - number of commits
  - number of merge commits
- analyze the variations of these indicators in time: for instance sum then in a week, compute a daily average or an average in a sliding window, ...
- visualize the indicators as charts (histograms, pie charts, etc.) embedded in a generated web page.

## Already existing similar tools

- [gitstats](https://pypi.org/project/gitstats/) 

## Technical means

- The charts are generated by a third party library (maybe a Java library generating pictures, or a javascript library which dynamically interprets the data).
- The data to analyze can be obtained using calls to the git CLI. For instance "git log", "git diff --numstat", and so on.

## Architecture

Visulog contains the following modules:

- data types for storing raw data directly extracted from git history, with relevant parsers
- a generator of numerical series (for the indicators mentioned above)
- a generator of web pages
- a command line program that calls the other modules using the provided command line parameters
- a shared module for configuration object definitions

## Usage

### Building the project

1. clone the repository
    ```
    git clone git@gaufre.informatique.univ-paris-diderot.fr:crisan/visulog.git
    ```
   or
    ```
    git clone https://gaufre.informatique.univ-paris-diderot.fr/crisan/visulog.git
    ```
2. Enter the project folder
    ```
    cd visulog
    ```
3. Only if you are on a SCRIPT computer (in one of the TPÂ rooms):
    ```
    source SCRIPT/envsetup
    ```
    This will setup the GRADLE_OPTS environment variable so that gradle uses the SCRIPT proxy for downloading its dependencies. It will also use a custom trust store (the one installed in the system is apparently broken... ).
4. run gradle wrapper (it will download all dependencies, including gradle itself)
    ```
    ./gradlew build
    ```
### Running the software

Currently, it can be run through gradle too. In order to pass program arguments, you need to pass them behind `--args`:
```
./gradlew run --args='here are my args'
```

For instance

```
./gradlew run --args='. --addPlugin=countCommits'
```

Will count the commits of each author in the current branch of the git repository present in the current folder (".").

For now, there is 5 differents program arguments:

Arguments | Alternative arguments | Actions 
--------- | -------------------- | -------
-p | -addPlugin | adds the selected plugin
-c | --loadConfigFile | loads the config file
-s | --justSaveConfigFile | saves the file as the config file
-i | --indent | indents the json in the display 
-o | --output | copies the output in a json file (creates it if it does not exists yet) 

### View countCommits and countAuthors in graphs
The results of these two plugins can be displayed on different types of graphs.

Run this command:
```
./gradlew run --args="-c ../config.yml
--serve 8080"
```
or 
```
./gradlew run -q --args="-c ../config.yml -o ../data.json"
```
then in visulog/frontend
```
python3 -m http.server
```

Once these commands done, check your browser in localhost, in the first command line, the port is 8080 (it depends on the port you selected previously with *--serve*). Otherwise it is 8000 if you used the python command line and you need to load the .json file (here it is data.json)

Now you have few options that are displayed:

The types of graphs:
- Pie (default)
- Doughnut
- Line

What informations you want to display :
- Count the total number of authors (countAuthors)
- Count the number of commits by authors (countCommits)
